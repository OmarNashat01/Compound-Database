# Compound-Database
Residential compound database project

The compound database is made to offer various services to a compound resident, compound owner, security and compound service providers.The project was implemented using SQL and c#.
The project implementation aimed at decreasing the amount of joint tables to reduce fetching time and increase the effeciency.There is also an encryption module to ensure the validity of access.

You can run this code on visual studio forms after connecting with the built database in Microsoft SQL.

You can easily run the project and sign up to create your account and access the parts that concern you as a user whether you are a resident, an owner, security or lastly a service provider.
There are error checks all over the form to ensure you are entering the right data at the right place.
